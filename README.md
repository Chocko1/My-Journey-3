With that said I will use this read me as a point to say it is 10th of feb 2024 and this git hub has made me hit a wall. I should be getting on now but Github is a wall I face.
So here goes lets see if I make through the task this time on Github. My plan is to follow Steves class again and use chat gpt. To show me how to take my site off code pen onto,
my local PC PUSH it to git hub and in the process try figure out github and how to us it. Bring on the climb.
